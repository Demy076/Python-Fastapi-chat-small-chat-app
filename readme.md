This is a fast written chat app, that is relatively primitive and low on security.

But it's a small example of how it could be done.

Client:

You need parcel or any web pack bundler to run this.
1: npm i -g parcel
2: parcel *.html (inside the client folder)

And in python u need a MongoDB server (atlas or localhosted)

Just do python main.py and see if u'r good to go

Both commands should open port
Parcel: 1234 (default unless overridden)
Python Fastapi: 3000 (default unless set otherwise in the code)

Enjoy
